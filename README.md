# ID Badge Generator

This project is a simple Python script that generates an ID badge based on user input. The script collects information such as the user's first name, last name, email address, phone number, job title, ID number, hair color, eye color, birth month, and whether they have completed additional training. It then prints out a formatted ID badge.
